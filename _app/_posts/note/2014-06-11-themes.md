## Overview

In the latest build, I've added multiple theme support, finally, you can switch themes with just one command.

Note: This is an experimental feature and may change until the feature stabilizes.

## Installing Themes

The AMSF framework ships a default theme [Curtana](https://github.com/sparanoid/amsf-curtana). You can also install as many themes as you like and switch to the one you like in any time.

Find a AMSF theme you like, download the package and uncompress all files to `_amsf/themes` directory, the file structure should look like:

```
├── _amsf/ (Almace Scaffolding cache directory)
|   ├── themes/
|   |   └── curtana/
|   |   |   └── assets/
|   |   |   └── includes/
|   |   |   └── layouts/
|   |   |   └── config.yml
└── _app/
```

Then execute the following command:


```sh
$ grunt switch --theme=curtana
```

You current theme will be backed up to `_amsf/themes/your-old-theme/` and the new theme will be installed to the appropriate directories.

## Upgrade Themes

You can update your current theme by the following command:

```sh
$ grunt theme-upgrade
```

Please note that only the activated theme will be updated.

## Creating Your Own Theme

You really like your custom design and wanna show it off to the world? Cool, you can create (package) you own theme by the following command:

```sh
$ grunt theme-save
```

The activated theme will be save to AMSF cache with correct file and directory structure, then you can upload your theme files to GitHub.

Still confusing? see my default theme [Curtana](https://github.com/sparanoid/amsf-curtana) for reference.
